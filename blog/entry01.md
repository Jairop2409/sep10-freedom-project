# Entry 1: Deciding on my topic (music) 
##### 10/23/23

### Context 
The topic I chose to cover was Music because of how it brings life to things no matter the size, shape, or form. I just was passionate about this topic so when I saw it I wanted to fulfill my passion and find ways how Technology  is  incorporated into this. I had other choices that interested me they were jewelry and food but it wasn't as intriguing or thrilling as music hence why I chose music. 
The links I used to investigate my topic about music were [Technology in music](https://www.britannica.com/art/musical-instrument/Technological-developments), [The evolution of music Technology](https://issuu.com/peteryarrow/docs/the_evolution_of_music_technology/s/21552177)  and [day in a life of a music manager](https://www.berklee.edu/careers/roles/artist-manager#:~:text=Artist%20managers%20guide%20every%20aspect,within%20larger%20productions%20and%20teams.).All these articles are helpful but there is one that impacted my thoughts and how I should look deeper to accomplish my goals it's the one that is from "issuu.com" This is organized and has a fixed timeline which helped me see evolutions of Technology and it's apurpose that strives in music. Lastly, without technology, the implementation of it would affect the ideas within music overall making it less updated. 

##  Engineering Design Process
As of right now I am on step 1 which is called **define the problem**. The problem I hope to resolve is the impact technology has on music and how it encapsulates the innovations due to advanced tools/ Technology such as **digital sequencers and synthesizers**. I am on the move to step 2 which is **researching** the problem and information about it whilelist this will take up some time to do this because the articles and websites have so much knowledge that I can learn from. 

## Skills 
I learned two skills so far throughout the process. 
One skill I learned was **time management** and **how to read** 
#### Time management

I learned this skill because I  don't have a  lot of free time due to homework from other classes, study, and take care of the house. Once I saw that I was going to have a lot of responsibilities I managed my time by making sure I spent less time on other homework's and spend more time on **projects** so that way I didn't have to stress about waiting last minute. Overall, this will not only help my grades and knowledge throughout this project but It will benefit my mental health and manage my time efficiently. 
Another skill I learned was 
### How to read 
Another skill I obtained so far is  **how to read** because when you search  The topic of whatever you want to see in this case, it would be **The evolution of music due to technology**, most of the time it would be articles or websites. This is different from a novel because an article goes in-depth and contains more information rather than a novel. To add, articles have whatever you are looking for added with facts or timelines that can help your research become informational and strong.
