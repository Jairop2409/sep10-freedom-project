The tool I chose to use on my freedom project was Aframe because it had cool animations and  it could make my website better. I tinkered Aframe by using jsbin and changing colors of a  shape to gold, Aqua and Lime green. The code I used was
```shell
 <a-box position="-1 0.5 -3" rotation="0 9 9" color="#FFD700"></a-box>
 ```
  This made the box have a gold color and made the box tilted due to the rotation if we want it to make it straight we would do `rotation="0 0 0 "`. The positioning describes how far the shape is from the plane field
