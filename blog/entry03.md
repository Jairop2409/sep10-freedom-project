# Entry 3: Music
##### 12/21/23

## Content
After thinking about the future and what's in store for music I tried to brainstorm solutions of how music can be adapted and thought about different ways of how music softwares can adapt to have more accessibility. I had ideas about how music applications can be free and be accessible anywhere. To add, I made sure everything was up and ready so it could be put up on the website by doing all the research efficiently and completing **Part A** and **Part B**. Another way I made sure that my content was ready was by checking for correct terms and using words where they belong like **software**, **hardware**, **future**  and **Part A/B**. One of the [websites](https://anthonyc2394.github.io/sep10-freedom-project/) , I used for inspiration because It helped me finalize my content and helped me generate ideas and thoughts. Another Website  I used for inspiration  was  [website 2](https://menghanj8072.github.io/sep10-freedom-project/) because it had everything organized and structured. The final website I used for inspiration  was [Website 3](https://natashas1525.github.io/sep10-freedom-project/) due to the lists of pros and cons and how Part A and Part B are seperated.
#### Part B summary
To wrap it up, my part B was about thinking about ideas that could affect music later on and see if it coexits in today's world as well as some applications that would benefit and make everyone have a great experience when it comes to music.
## Engineering Design Process
At this moment, I am currently in step 3 **Brainstorm possible solutions** which was all about future technology and how I  can come up with ideas that could affect history. The next step is step 4 **Plan the promising solution** and actually put these ideas into action. Finally,  I am going to see realistic actions to take in occurred to insure the solution
## Skills 
- I inquired two  skills called "**Creativity**" and "**Growth Mindset**"
#### Creativity
- One way I learned Creavity was to bring about new ideas about innovations that could be seen and be in the future, this required me to think differently and think about what exists and what doesn't.
- Another way I learned Creavitiy was figuring out the function of different applications. 
#### Growth Mindset 
- I learned a Growth mindset because I asked peers for help and used their help to guide me and was persistent and patient and had a positive outlook to not get easily defeated.
