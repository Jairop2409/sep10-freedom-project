## Content

#### Takeaways from in class-presentation(1/2)
- During the process of doing my in-class presentation I noticed as I was speaking, I was explaining too much about my topic and had to sum up what my topic was with fewer words.
    * Another thing I noticed was that speaking a normal tone of voice and knowing what your topic is about is crucial because it will eventually affect your audience and if they find it entertaining.

#### What I did before the presentation
* One thing I did to practice for this presentation was talking to peers to receive feedback and see what I can improve on
* Another thing was timing myself to see If I used a good amount of time and explained everything well.

#### Takeaways from giving  Expo Pitchs(2/2)
* Some takeaways of giving my Expo Pitchs was to minimize what I wanted to show to the people viewing my website.
    * Another takeaway was to make sure I had everything ready for the  expo.

## Engineering Design Process
I have finally finished the freedom project with the final step **Communicate the results**. I did this through communicating my website in my expo and presentation.
## Skills
I have gained two final skills through my last step of this freedom project. I have gained the ability of **Communication** and **Considertaion**
