## Content

#### Takeaways from in class-presentation(1/2)
- During the process of doing my in class presentation I noticed as I was speaking, I was explaining too much about my topic and had to sum up whaat my topic was with less words.
    * Another thing I noticed was that speaking a normal tone of voice and knowing what your topic is about is crusial because it will eventually affect your audience and if they find it entertaining.

#### What I did before the presentation
* One thing I did to pratice for this presentation was taking to peers to recieve feedback and see what I can improve on
* Another thing was timing myself to see If I used a good amount of time and explained everything well.

#### Takeaways from giving  Expo Pitchs(2/2)
* Some takeaways of giving my Expo Pitchs was to minimize  and what I wanted to show to the people viewing my website.
    * Another takeaway was to make sure I had everything ready for the  expo.
