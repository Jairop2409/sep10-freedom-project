# Entry 6 : Music
##### 5/4/24

## Content
As, I started making my freedom project I first had to make a wireframe and plan so  I can organize how I wanted to deliver the information and how I wanted  my texts, components, headers, paragraphs, ect structured in a way that makes it organized and take up the right amount of space.

##### Step 1: Wireframing part A
The first thing I had to do was wireframing my project so I can make my project easier and less stressful to make.
 * The image belows shows the wirefrane I made
 ![wireframe](../prep/Mobilefirst.png)
After I made my wireframe I was moved on to the planning and which day to dedicate what part of my project.
* example:
    * monday- adding navbar

my planning days are below or rather my timeline
#### Timeline- step 1 part B
* 4/17--> Add navbar
* 4/18- 4/19/24 -->  Adding fp tool: Aframe and  Context
    * Using * Add animation using Aframe
* 4/20/24 --> adding  Carosoul OF timeline of Software Applications (Part A)
    * 4/4 slides with logos of the the software's
* 4/21-4/25/24 --> Hardware application timeline
    * +Pictures/logos
* 4/26 -->  Innovations about music for the future(Part B)
    * ( Bootstrap component- List groups and/or cards)

4/27-29/24-->
* Position it, make sure it has the fonts chosen and give it a color. (checking for errors)
#### If not done with everything by 4/28- /4/29/24 then,
* if two  days behind then
    * 4/27/24-  day 1
    * 4/28-4/29 - Day 2

As shown above the timeline demostrates   how I planned to make my freedom project on different days.
##  How I made my Freedom project
* Once I  finished wireframing and planning I was able to start my freedom project.
* The first thing I did was adding my navbar that I got from [bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/components/navbar/) and at first the color was weird so I changed it to a white using css.
* The next thing I did was making an intro to music and I added a border, background color, I positioned it. I did all of this through css.

The code I used was
``` css
.navbar-expand-lg{
  background-color:grey;
  }
  .paragraph{
    margin: 20px;
    padding:40px;
    font-size: 16px;
    text-align:center;
    border:16px solid black;
    background-color:blue;
    color:white;
    font-size:30px;
  }
  ```

The code above is what I used for the css of my paragraph that says " Music". As I continued my freedom project I had to  remember what I learned all year and used inspect elements to help me make the project reach mvp and make little errors. Overall I made my project through bootstrap, using old notes and inspecting elements.

#### Challenges of the freedom project
* One struggle I faced was centering elements to make it look neat and organized but I was unable to center it
    * Goal-> beyond Mvp
* Another struggle I faced was adding my aframe tool to the website because I never knew how to do it but after reading  the [aframepage](https://aframe.io/docs/1.5.0/components/embedded.html) on adding scenes that are displayable on my page.
    * Goal-> reached
* The final struggle I faced overall was making my bootstrap responsive because it required javascript but the code I used was
``` html
 <link href="css/styles.css" rel="stylesheet" />
        <link href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.3.3/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css" rel="stylesheet" integrity="sha384-QWTKZyjpPEjISv5WaRU9OFeRpok6YctnYmDr5pNlyT2bRjXh0JMhjY6hW+ALEwIH" crossorigin="anonymous">
```
I added this piece of code from bootstrap onto my head element.
* Goal -> reached

#### Takeaways
Some takeaways from making my freedom project is that there will always be something that seems off or not right but you have to remember your notes and to check the information on the website to help you with your questions and if not then watching videos such as the videos I watched on aframe to  add aframe onto the freedom project. Finally, what I learned most about this freedom project is to check if you pushed your commits, have things centered, organized and or/ colorful.

## Sources
The sources I used when doing my freedom project are the following
* [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/getting-started/introduction/)
* [ww3 schools](https://www.w3schools.com/)
* [Aframe](https://aframe.io/docs/1.5.0/introduction/)

+ the sources used for researching music innovations

## Engineering Design Process
As of right now I am on step 5  `**Create a prototype**` where I have made  my website but I still have  to go beyond mvp and improve my website to be free of errors. The next step is step 6 `**Test and evaluate the prototype**`  AKA the `beyond mvp`
