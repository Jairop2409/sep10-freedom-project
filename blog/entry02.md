  ## Softwares  applications and how it is included in music
  
   -  Once I finally figured the topic I wanted to cover The first thing I had to do was look for software applications regarding Music . I did this by conducting a  search of "**Music apps**" but it didn't give me the results I wanted so then I did a second search that said "Music software apps" and it finally gave me a software called "**Fl studio**". This software application is great if you want a mixture of  harmony, tone and melody, this application will create different effects to make your music outstanding and make users have lively experiences.

 - The second  software application I found was "**REAPER**"". This application let's you import sounds and edit and make change's to it. [reaper](https://www.g2.com/products/reaper/reviews#) states the reviews and the pros and cons of using REAPER.

## Hardware in music
After, I looked for the software applications I had to look for  how hardware was intergrated into music. The first thing  I did was look for “**Music hardwares**”  so I could find the hardwares that exist. While there were a lot of information none of them had preciely what I was looking for, so I expanded my search and looked for "**Music devices**". In addition it gave me what I was looking for and [Music player source ](https://www.audiophileon.com/news/hd-music-player-top-10) talks about the different types of hardwares in a music player.
