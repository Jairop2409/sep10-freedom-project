## Softwares and Hardwares applications and how it is included in music

   - Once I finally figured the topic I wanted to cover The first thing I had to do was look for software applications regarding Music . I did this by conducting a  search of "**Music apps**" but it didn't give me the results I wanted so then I did a second search that said "Music software apps" and it finally gave me a software called "**Fl studio**". This software application is great if you want a mixture of  harmony, tone and melody, this application will create different effects to make your music outstanding and make users have lively experiences. [pcmag](https://www.pcmag.com/reviews/image-line-fl-studio#:~:text=We%27re%20happy%20to%20say,workflow%20and%20stellar%20sound%20quality.) explains the benefit's of using **Fl studio** and disadvantages of using it.
