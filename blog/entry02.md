  ## Software applications and how it is included in music
  
   -  Once I finally figured out the topic I wanted to cover The first thing I had to do was look for software applications regarding Music. I did this by searching for "**Music apps**" but it didn't give me the results I wanted so then I did a second search that said "Music software apps" and it finally gave me a software called "**Fl studio**". This software application is great if you want a mixture of harmony, tone, and melody, this application will create different effects to make your music outstanding and make users have lively experiences. [pcmag](https://www.pcmag.com/reviews/image-line-fl-studio#:~:text=We%27re%20happy%20to%20say,workflow%20and%20stellar%20sound%20quality.) explains the benefit's of using **Fl studio** and disadvantages of using it.
 - The second software application I found was "**REAPER**". This application lets you import sounds, edit and make changes to them. [reaper](https://www.g2.com/products/reaper/reviews#) states the reviews and the pros and cons of using REAPER.

## Hardware in music
After, I looked for the software applications I had to look for  how the hardware was integrated into music. The first thing  I did was look for “**Music hardwares**”  so I could find the hardwares that exists. While there were a lot of information none of them had precisely what I was looking for, so I expanded my search and looked for "**Music devices**". In addition it gave me what I was looking for and [Music player source ](https://www.audiophileon.com/news/hd-music-player-top-10) talks about the different types of hardwares in a music player. What is a music player? you may ask well a music player is  a Device or an application that records and plays digital files.
- Music players are composed by  mulitple hardwares 
    - The first hardware is a speaker and a speaker is something that produces sounds
    - The second hardware is a screen which is just a flat surface on a device, found in computers and other electronics
    - The last hardware of a music player is a button which is just a function that lets users act upon the action

The second hardware was a "**Hifi Walker** " and [Hifi](https://www.audiophile-heaven.com/2023/02/hifi-walker-h2-touch-revised-and-upgraded.html) talks about the physical properties.

-  Hifi Walker is An effective portable player  that transmits audio
    -  The first hardware is a capacitors= contains energy
    -  The second hardware is a wire= transmits electricity 

## Engineering Design Process
I have now moved to step 2 which is **researching**. I have looked at various credible sources that helped me find the innovations of music that exist today but what does the future hold for these technologies of music?. This will be covered in step 3 **brainstorming  possible solutions** while the technology of today is advanced, it can always be modifired to become better and convenient for everyone. To sum it up, I am going to find solutions in step 3 to make music applications more reliant and have an affect in society later on.

## Skills
Throughout this whole step I have improved with the skills(**Time Management** and  **How to read**)

how?
#### Time management  
- One way I improved in managing my time was setting time for this project and which I mentioned I also made sure the homework's from other classes didn't take up too much time .
- Another way is using free time or whenever I have time to do homework so when I do this project I don't get overwhelmed with the amount of work I have to do.
#### How to read 
I have become better on how to read passages and articles due to the research and seeing if the article has exactly what I'm looking for. To add, the amount of information was crusial. 

## Summary 
To wrap it up, this whole step was about  looking for software and hardware applications, managing time, and seeing if sources were trustworthy. This whole step was a lot but It's important to know your goal for your topic for the future and how we can change it so it can have more options and not be limited to some.
