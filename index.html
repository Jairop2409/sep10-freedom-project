        <p class="paragraph2">Some things for the future/future innovations </p>
        <ul class="list-group">
          <li class="list-group-item">App that tells you the music your friend listenes to
         this can be done as Receving  connections from your  friend’s music taste and can find what you and your friend have in common as well as it Tells you songs in common to your friends music as well as the other way around
            Has like a “fyp” but with music
            </li>
          <li class="list-group-item">No cost this means Music is free and there will be almost no ads every hour or so  Alongside no cost it will also have an ai feature which allows you to do more things to your sounds and not only listen to it
           </li>
          <li class="list-group-item">Access music globally because Most countries ban access to songs so maybe the ability of an app to let you listen no matter where you are. To add maybe being able to  Determine what song is playing without using”shazam” or using another music service app,   Different versions of music are available like a music player and spotify- one requires real life tools and the other plays on the web   Based on your surrounding it affects the volume that you listen to music like high volume
       </li>
          <li class="list-group-item">In conclusion a innovation that would change the way music goes is through AI. AI has recently changed the world and caused problems but also helped the world. People are taking voices of real people and making a fake song or music out of it. The ideas I thought of was Using  sounds and  the device will make sounds and create sounds,  Computer make sounds, humans don’t have to make it and finally Ai will make an enhanced experience
